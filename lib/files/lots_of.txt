On October 1, 2013, the United States federal government entered a shutdown suspending services not excepted by the Antideficiency Act.[1] Because Congress did not enact regular appropriations or a continuing resolution for the 2014 fiscal year, appropriations have lapsed and about 800,000 federal employees were indefinitely furloughed without pay, while another 1.3 million "excepted" employees were required to report to work for some indefinite period without pay until an appropriations bill is passed or their function is no longer excepted. The most recent of the previous U.S. federal government shutdowns was in 1995â€“96. The shutdown resulted from political fights between Democratic President Barack Obama, the Democratic-led Senate with Harry Reid and the Republican-led House of Representatives with John Boehner. The Republicans included separate measures delaying the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (commonly known as Obamacare) into the House appropriations bills, and the Democrats rejected these measures.
